# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application
This is the sample application for
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).

As I follow along with this tutorial, I am using [Cucmber](http://cukes.info) for integration testing and [MiniTest](http://github.com/seattlerb/minitest) for unit testing, instead of RSpec.
